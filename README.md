# Movie-Recommendation-System

This repository contains a simple recommendation system implemented in Python using Pandas. The system is designed to suggest movies that are most similar to a particular movie selected by the user.

## Features

- **Item-Based Recommendation**: Recommends movies similar to a user's chosen movie based on the movie's features.
- **Similarity Measurement**: Uses cosine similarity to determine the closeness between movies.
- **Data Handling**: Utilizes Pandas for efficient data manipulation and processing.

## How It Works

The recommendation system works by:

1. **Loading the Dataset**: A dataset containing movies and their respective features (e.g., genres, ratings).
2. **Calculating Similarities**: Computes similarity scores between the selected movie and all other movies in the dataset.
3. **Recommending Movies**: Suggests the top N movies that are most similar to the selected movie.
